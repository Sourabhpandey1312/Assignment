# Predicting Audience Ratings for Movies

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the `audience_rating` of movies using a dataset containing information about movies, their features, and ratings. A machine learning model is built to make these predictions, and the project includes a demonstration of the data pipeline and model validation.

seaborn
scipy
scikit-learn
statsmodels


## Steps to Run the Project

1.	Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2. Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb

jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb

## Output

The pipeline generates:
